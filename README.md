# Binary-Survival-Classification-using-Graph-Neural-Network
# Overview
This notebook walks you through building and running a Graph Neural Network (GNN) that predicts breast cancer patient survival (alive vs. deceased) using multi-omics data from the TCGA BRCA dataset. Everything from loading the raw data to visualizing results is laid out step-by-step so you can run it interactively and explore the process as you go.

# Getting Started
Open the notebook (e.g., `Binary_Survival_Classification_using_GNN.ipynb` ) in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
Make sure `data.csv` is in the same folder.
Run the cells in order — outputs and plots will appear inline as you progress.
# Before You Begin
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow networkx scipy
# Notebook Flow
**Setup:** Import libraries, set configurations, and silence unnecessary warnings.

**Data Loading & Cleaning:** Read in the dataset, handle missing values, fix labels, and balance classes.

**Graph Construction:** Build an adjacency matrix from feature correlations or k-nearest neighbors, with optional feature reduction for memory efficiency.

**Visualization:** See class distributions, PCA plots, and heatmaps.

**Model Creation:** Define a custom GNN layer, build the model, and review its architecture.

**Training & Evaluation:** Train with progress tracking, early stopping, and best-model saving; evaluate with accuracy, ROC curves, and classification reports.

**Feature Importance:** Highlight which features influence predictions most using gradient-based attribution.

# Running the Notebook
*Simply execute the **cells top to bottom**.
*Long steps like training will display progress bars.
*If you stop midway, just restart from the relevant step.

# Customization Ideas

Change graph type or thresholds to experiment with connectivity.
Modify the model’s architecture — tweak layer sizes, dropout, or add attention.
Replace random upsampling with SMOTE or class weights for imbalanced data.
Use sparse matrices for larger datasets.
Try advanced interpretability methods like Integrated Gradients.

# Troubleshooting

**Memory errors:** Lower the number of features or reduce batch size.
**File not found:** Double-check that `data.csv` is in the right location.
**Plots not showing:** Make sure `%matplotlib inline` is at the top.
**Reproducibility:** Set random seeds for NumPy, TensorFlow, and Python.

# Future Enhancements

Turn the notebook into a Python script or module.
Try better handling of class imbalance with focal loss or advanced sampling.
Use real biological interaction networks (STRING, BioGRID) for graph edges.
Explore GATs, edge-conditioned GNNs, or multi-omics heterogeneous graphs
